# Visualizing-Hidden-Stories-Using-Deep-Learning

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to make a mobile application that can detect the statue and play an embedded video in seconds on the screen with no hassle, by just pointing the camera at it. This app makes it easy to learn the history behind the statues without any extra effort.
