# Visualizing-Hidden-Stories-Using-Deep-Learning

## Introduction
<p align="justify">The purpose of this project is to make a mobile application that can detect the statue and play an embedded video in seconds on the screen with no hassle, by just pointing the camera at it. This app makes it easy to learn the history behind the statues without any extra effort.</p>

<p align="justify"> To achieve our goal first, we created a Machine Learning(ML) image classification model and converted it to Open Neural Network Exchange(ONNX) file format. Then we simulated and tested the model in Unity with the Barracuda inference engine. Finally, we deployed our model to an iOS device. </p>
